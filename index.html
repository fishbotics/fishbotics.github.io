            <p>
            I am a fourth-year Computer Science PhD student in <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu">The Allen School at The University of Washington</a>, where I am co-advised by <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~fox/">Dieter Fox</a> and <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bboots/">Byron Boots</a>. I'm interested in robotics and AI of all kinds, but I'm currently focused on training end-to-end deep models for closed-loop manipulator control in complex, partially observable environments.
            </p>
            <p>
            Previously, I worked as a Computer Vision Engineer at Oculus VR. While there, I helped build the SLAM system for <a href="https://www.oculus.com/quest/">Oculus Quest</a>.

              I like to ride bikes, hike with my dog, and make pizza.
